Questions

**1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?**
Fashion-MNIST dataset is a public image dataset commonly used in machine learning and computer vision, especially for training and testing classification models.

**2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?**
To make the learning process faster, and more accurate.

**3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.**
Flatten Layer: coverts a 2D image into a 1D vector.
Dense layer: learns pattern by connecting every neuron to the previous layer.

**4. What does an epoch mean in model training?**
It means one complete pass of the entire training dataset through the model during training.

**5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.**
For the first test image, the predicted label matches the actual label.

**6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?**
By using a better model like CNN, tuning parameters, and training longer.
